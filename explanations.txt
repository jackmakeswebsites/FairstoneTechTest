ISSUES

index.html
- The <nav> section of the webpage was within the <head> - I have moved this into the body section
- The <nav> section didn't use correctly formatted links or any container - I have used .navbar-expand and set a fluid container
- The 'about' link was linking to abou.html - I have corrected this
- Although ... technically not wrong, the <style> section was placed at the bottom of the page before the closing <body> tag ... I hve chosen to add this to a stabdalone css file
- Again not really an issue - but I have placed the javascript loading to the end of the page, so the HTML content loads first
- The carousel was referencing three images, the third image (image4.jpg) doesn't exist - I have set the third image to load image3.jpg
- The carousel wrapper <div> referenced the same class twice - I have removed the duplicate class referenced
- Slide 1 & 3 black clashes, so made this lighter text
- Carousel was inconsistent with image heights - I have added some custom css to custom.css to make all the images equal in height
- I have created a container for the Modal button
- I have set the footer text to be properly vertically centered within the footer itself

about.html
- 

custom.css (originally inline style for index.html)
- .carousel-caption class had english spelling of colour - I changed this to color (which is correct for css)
- .title had 'fontsize' - I have changed this to 'font-size'
- I have commented out the modal section - it appears to be attempting to achieve what bootstrap already achieves off the bat
- To make the modal more like a lightbox, I have added a few custom classes to custom.css
